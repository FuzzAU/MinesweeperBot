# MinesweeperBot

This is my attempt at making a minesweeper game, and a bot that can play assist in playing it.

## Dependancies

The game's interface is built on [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/).
See their website for installation instuctions.

On Ubuntu based systems you can install PyGame with:

```Shell
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

## Playing
You can start the game by running
```Shell
./MineBot-Pygame
```

- Click the square to reveal it.
- Right click a square to mark it as a bomb 

Press 's' to get the bot to play the next move for you
