# MinesweeperBot

This is my attempt at making a minesweeper game, and a bot that can play assist in playing it.

## Dependancies

The game can be played via a [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/) interface, or [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide).
See their website for installation instuctions.

## PyGame
On Ubuntu based systems you can install PyGame with:

```Shell
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```
### Playing
You can start the game by running
```Shell
./MineBot-Pygame
```

- Click the square to reveal it.
- Right click a square to mark it as a bomb 

Press 's' to get the bot to play the next move for you

## PySide

On Ubuntu based systems you can install PySide with:

``Shell
sudo apt-get install python-pyside
``
