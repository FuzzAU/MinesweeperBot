Mine Placement - JY:
Newer implementations of minesweeper actually move mines away from the initial starting position that
the user has selected.

This can be done by delaying the mine placement until the user does their first selection, and then
removing the clicked square and adjacents from the allowed squares for mine placement

OR

By waiting for the user to make their selection, and just move those mines away near the clicked point.

It is possible for there to not be enough locations to move mines to in some circumstances
